- Branch protection active on main branch requiring checks
- Automated deployment to staging environment
- Pull request template enforced for all changes
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day  
**Dependencies**: Database fixes  
**Risk**: Medium - affects development velocity

### Task 3: Complete AI System Integration ü§ñ
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Connect frontend to full multi-agent AI research system  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 5 specialist AI agents coordinate for historical analysis
- Frontend displays agent-specific responses
- Fallback functionality maintains memorial accessibility
- AI research provides comprehensive historical context
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Dependencies**: Database stability, OpenAI API configuration  
**Risk**: Medium - enhances but not critical to memorial mission

### Task 4: Production Hosting Migration üåê
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Migrate from Manus to permanent hosting platform  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Memorial accessible at permanent URL with custom domain
- 99.9% uptime SLA with monitoring
- Automated backup and disaster recovery
- SSL certificate and security headers configured
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Dependencies**: CI/CD pipeline, database fixes  
**Risk**: Medium - affects long-term sustainability

### Task 5: Performance Optimization ‚ö°
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Implement caching and database indexing for faster responses  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Sub-200ms response times for all search queries
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Frontend caching for static memorial content
- Performance monitoring dashboard active
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days  
**Dependencies**: Database stability, production hosting  
**Risk**: Low - improves but doesn't affect core functionality

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Database Connection Instability**: Could affect memorial accessibility
- **Staging Environment Issues**: Blocking development and testing

### Medium Risk Items
- **AI System Complexity**: May delay advanced features but fallback exists
- **Hosting Platform Dependency**: Need migration plan for long-term sustainability

### Low Risk Items
- **Performance Optimization**: Memorial currently accessible with acceptable performance
- **Additional Features**: Enhancement rather than core functionality
