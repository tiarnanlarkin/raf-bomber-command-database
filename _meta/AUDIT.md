# Project Audit - RAF Bomber Command Database

## Current State Assessment

### Project Overview
- **Name**: RAF Bomber Command Research Database
- **Purpose**: Memorial database with AI research capabilities honoring RAF personnel
- **Status**: Active development, staging phase
- **Memorial Focus**: Sergeant Patrick Cassidy (Service #1802082) and all RAF Bomber Command personnel

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python 3.11)
- **Database**: SQLite with personnel, aircraft, squadrons, missions tables
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (single-page application)
- **AI System**: Multi-agent research system with OpenAI integration
- **Deployment**: Manus hosting platform

### Current Features
✅ **Working**:
- Personnel search (10 records including Patrick Cassidy)
- Aircraft database (4 aircraft including Lancaster JB174)
- Statistics dashboard
- AI research assistant (fallback mode)
- Professional RAF-themed UI
- Mobile responsive design
- Accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA)

⚠️ **Issues**:
- Database connection problems in staging
- AI system not fully integrated
- No CI/CD pipeline
- Missing documentation structure
- No branch protection
- No proper testing framework

### GitHub Repository
- **URL**: https://github.com/tiarnanlarkin/raf-bomber-command-database
- **Status**: Basic structure, needs alignment
- **Branches**: main only
- **Protection**: None

### Deployment Status
- **Staging**: Multiple attempts, database connection issues
- **Production**: Previous successful deployment at https://58hpi8cw090y.manus.space
- **Current**: Working on fixes in staging environment

### Memorial Dedication
The project successfully preserves the memory of:
- Sergeant Patrick Cassidy (1802082) - Flight Engineer, 97 Squadron RAF Pathfinders
- Wing Commander Guy Gibson - Dam Busters leader
- 10 total personnel records with complete biographies
- 4 aircraft records including Lancaster JB174

### Next Phase Requirements
1. Fix database connection issues
2. Implement proper project structure
3. Add CI/CD pipeline
4. Enable branch protection
5. Complete AI system integration
6. Deploy to production hosting

### Risk Assessment
- **High**: Database connection instability
- **Medium**: Missing CI/CD could cause deployment issues
- **Low**: Memorial content is well-preserved and accessible

### Success Metrics
- Memorial accessibility: ✅ Excellent
- Technical functionality: ⚠️ 85% (database issues)
- User experience: ✅ Professional quality
- Documentation: ❌ Needs improvement
- Maintainability: ⚠️ Needs structure

## Alignment Priorities
1. **Critical**: Fix database connection and staging deployment
2. **High**: Implement proper project structure and CI/CD
3. **Medium**: Complete AI system integration
4. **Low**: Additional features and enhancements
