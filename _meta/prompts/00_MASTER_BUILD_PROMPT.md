# Master Build Prompt

- Build in Manus staging first. Push to GitHub `main` only after checks pass.
- No WIP in GitHub. Tag releases (`vX.Y.Z`).
- Keep `/docs` and `/_meta` in sync; update `/_meta/TASKS.md` and `/_meta/DECISIONS.md` as you work.
- If blocked, pause, summarize, suggest escalation (ChatGPT/Claude), await confirmation.
- **Before building, read:** `/docs/PREPRODUCTION.md` & `/docs/PREPRODUCTION.json`.
