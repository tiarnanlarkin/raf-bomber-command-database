The system now stands as a testament to both historical preservation and modern accessibility standards, incorporating advanced AI research capabilities, comprehensive security measures, and full WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance. This memorial database honors the memory of 125,012+ RAF personnel with the dignity and technical excellence they deserve.

## Project Overview

### Memorial Foundation
The database was created to preserve the memory of Sergeant Patrick Cassidy (Service Number 1802082), a Flight Engineer with 97 Squadron RAF Pathfinders who was killed when Lancaster JB174 was shot down during a raid on Hanover on 8/9 October 1943. At just 20 years old, Patrick exemplified the courage and dedication of RAF Bomber Command aircrew. He is commemorated on the Runnymede Memorial Panel 119.

### Technical Achievement
What began as a simple memorial concept has evolved into a sophisticated research platform featuring multi-agent AI analysis, advanced search capabilities, comprehensive accessibility features, and production-grade security. The system successfully balances memorial dignity with cutting-edge technology to create an unparalleled historical research resource.
